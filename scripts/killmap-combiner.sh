# Combines a partial killmap with the result of an incremental run
# (presumably the first run timed out), to produce a single, full
# killmap.
#
# Usage:
#   killmap-combiner.sh first-half.killmap.csv.gz second-half.killmap.csv.gz full.killmap.csv.gz
#
# The inputs should both be gzipped files; the output will also be
# gzipped. Exits with status 1 if it can't figure out how to glue the
# two halves together.
